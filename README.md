# Building-with-Polygon-Bridge

Creating an NFT collection, deploying it on the Ethereum testnet, mapping it to the Polygon network, and writing scripts to mint, transfer, and test balances involves a series of complex steps. Due to the space constraints, I'll provide an outline of the process along with some code snippets. You'll need to fill in the details and adapt the code to your specific needs. Let's get started:

### 1. Generate a 5-item collection using DALLE 2 or Midjourney
- Generate your collection using DALLE 2 or Midjourney. Ensure you have the image files ready.

### 2. Store items on IPFS using Pinata.cloud
- Upload your image files to Pinata.cloud or any other IPFS hosting service. Retrieve the IPFS URLs for each image.

### 3. Deploy an ERC721 or ERC1155 to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet
- Write your smart contract using Solidity.
- Use Hardhat to compile and deploy your contract.
- Make sure to include the `promptDescription` function that returns the prompt used to generate the images.

### 4. Map Your NFT Collection using Polygon network token mapper
- Use the token mapper provided by Polygon to map your ERC721 tokens from Ethereum to Polygon.

### 5. Write a hardhat script to batch mint all NFTs
```javascript
// Hardhat script to batch mint ERC721 tokens
async function main() {
  const YourNFTContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("YourNFTContract");
  const nftContract = await YourNFTContract.deploy();
  await nftContract.deployed();

  const accounts = await ethers.getSigners();
  const signer = accounts[0];

  // Mint NFTs
  const tokenURIs = [...]; // Array of IPFS URIs for each NFT
  for (const uri of tokenURIs) {
    await nftContract.mint(signer.address, uri);
  }
}

main();
```

### 6. Write a hardhat script to batch transfer all NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon Mumbai using the FxPortal Bridge
```javascript
// Hardhat script to batch transfer ERC721 tokens from Ethereum to Polygon Mumbai
async function main() {
  // Connect to your Ethereum and Polygon Mumbai networks

  // Approve NFTs to be transferred to the bridge

  // Deposit NFTs to the bridge
}

main();
```

### 7. Test balanceOf on Mumbai
- Write tests using Hardhat to verify the balance of your NFTs on the Polygon Mumbai network.


This outline should provide you with a good starting point for implementing your NFT collection deployment and transfer scripts. Remember to fill in the details and adapt the code snippets to your specific requirements and environment.
